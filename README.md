# og-karpagam
Karpagam College Programming exercise repository

Git clone:
First step is to clone the directory in your local workspace(laptop or computer).

Steps:
1. Create directory: Every student/team needs to create a separate folder in their name or their team name
2. Create Files: Every week exercise program should be created in the above created folder. Each program must contain "WEEK" and the week number at the start of each Program.
   Example: $og-karpagam/<name>/WEEK1-Linkedlist_copy.<extn>
3. Please note, you will only create one folder per student or team.
